# GlobaLLM

AI-powered open source contribution orchestration at scale.

## Overview

GlobaLLM is a system for identifying the most impactful open source libraries and contributing to their success using autonomous AI agents. It solves the resource allocation problem: with unlimited access to hyper-competent LLMs and finite compute, how do you maximize positive impact on the software ecosystem?

## Key Features

- **Impact analysis** to identify repositories where contributions matter most
- **Budget controls** (time, tokens, cost) to allocate resources efficiently
- **Monitoring dashboards** to observe agent progress with metrics and KPIs
- **Automated workflows** that bypass human review bottlenecks for trusted changes

## Documentation

- [Installation Guide](../README.md#installation)
- [Usage Documentation](../README.md#usage)
- [Specifications](spec/) - Detailed technical specifications for each feature

## Rules for Agents

- Identify which projects are worth maintaining vs. archiving/deprecating
- Eliminate redundant or unused projects (reconcile features, deprecate duplicates)
- Prioritize high-impact changes over lint/style fixes
- Focus on a targeted set of languages rather than reinventing the wheel
- Replace closed-source standards with open-source equivalents
- Use dependency graphs and stars to determine importance

## Ultimate Goals

Thinking at the highest level, GlobaLLM aims to tackle problems that are fundamentally social:

- Reduce the wealth gap
- Reduce homelessness
- Reduce pain caused by diseases
- Find better societal solutions

Better software is a means to these ends.
